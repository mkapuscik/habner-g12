### Configuring Hardware Version
This branch uses a super basic HAL and as a result must be told what version of hardware it is running on. [Edit the config here](https://github.com/slapplebags/Tracksoar-Firmware/blob/BME280-support/Tracksoar/Firmware/tracksoar/config.h#L30) to have the corect version uncommented. Everything before V1.2 should work as it normally did on the old set of sensors.


# Tracksoar Firmware

This is a modified version of the [trackduino](https://github.com/trackuino/trackuino) firmware for the [Tracksoar](www.tracksoar.com) hardware.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
